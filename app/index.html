<!-- A better and more natural way to initialize data is through javascript
     We will now start using the js/controllers.js file. In there we will 
     create a contoller, and create teh variables there -->
<!-- we can use a controller with the ng-controller directive This will
     inject the variables we declared on $scope, and make them available
     for our use -->
<!-- The variables created inside the Phone Controller will be available
     insde the element we wplace the ng-contoller directive in, and all
     of it's children directives-->
  <section ng-controller='StoreController'>
    <h1>Welcome to our {{store}} </h1>
    <h2> Our Products </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        {{productOne.name}} Cost: {{productOne.cost}}
      </li>
      <li>
        {{productTwo.name}} Cost: {{productTwo.cost}}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <!-- outside of the above element, we won't have access to the valued
    defined by StoreController. ng-controller scoping is very much like
    javascript function scoping -->
  <p> After this colon there will be nothing: {{store}}</p>

  <!-- However, we can create multiple instances of our controller, just like
    how we can consume a vanilla js constructor function multiple times -->
  <p ng-controller='StoreController'> After this colon there will be something: {{store}}</p>
  <!-- Lab
    Refactor your store app to use a controller instead. Experiment with the scoping
    rules of ng-controller for yourself. Create multiple ng-controllers, and quiz a partner
    on how the angular expressions will be evaluated
