    <!-- we know must prefix all of our scope accesses with store. while initially
      this might as nothing but added verbosity, doing our templates this way makes
      our code much more clear. People reading our code can now easily determine which
      controller a variable came from, which comes in handy when we start nesting
      scopes. Later on we'll see this alsy enables variable shadowing like in vanilla
      javascript -->
