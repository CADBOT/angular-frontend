    <!-- There is a lot of replication in this code. Let's dry it up by moving our
         products to an array in the controller, and using ng-repeat to loop through
         it. the syntax is very much like a for each loop-->

    <!-- lab convert your store tu use ng-repeat -->

      array indexing  -->

      Item Number: {{$index}} | {{product.name}} Cost: {{product.cost}}

    <!-- Aside from $index, therse are all predicates (return true or false). Alone, they aren't very useful.
      However, we can combine them with ng-if, which is a directive to conditionally display
      dom nodes -->
    <li ng-repeat='product in store.products' ng-if='$first'>
      {{product.name}} Cost: {{product.cost}}
    </li>
    <!-- here we will only display the first element in a list. Later on we will discuss how to use
         ng-repeat filters as a more elegant way to do this -->
    <!-- Create a section that only displays even indexed products. Create one that displays only the last one
         Crate one using $index and $ng-if that only displays the 2nd element -->

    <li ng-repeat='product in store.products' ng-if='$index == 1'>
      {{product.name}} Cost: {{product.cost}}
