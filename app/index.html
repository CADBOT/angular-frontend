           more limited(no control flow statements or function declarations)

  <!-- Lab
    Give 10-15 minutes for students to create there own store app. It should have 3 
    products and be done purely with ng-init, ng-bind and ng-bind-template
    Students should also experiment with evaluating Angular Expressions
